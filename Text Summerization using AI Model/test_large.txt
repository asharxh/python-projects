I’m looking for a skilled backend developer to build and deploy a lightweight WhatsApp bot.
The bot will receive a photo of a dress on a mannequin from the user, send the image with a preset prompt to the Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (“Nano Banana”) model, and return the edited image (with a real model) back to the user through WhatsApp.

The entire flow should be automated, stable, and production-ready. Ideally built in Python (FastAPI) or Node.js, and deployed on a simple hosting service (e.g., Render, Fly.io, Cloud Run).

Deliverables
WhatsApp Webhook Setup
Set up webhook using Meta’s WhatsApp Cloud API.
Handle incoming messages and media (image) from users.
Verify webhook subscription with a VERIFY_TOKEN.
Image Download & Upload
Download user-sent mannequin image using media ID.
Upload processed image back to WhatsApp and send as a reply.
Gemini API Integration
Call Gemini 2.5 Flash Image API with:
User image as input
Preset prompt provided by me (e.g., Put this on a middle eastern female model in a minimalistic outdoors background)
Handle response and extract generated image.
Bot Logic
Limit number of images per batch (e.g., max 10 per user per session).
Return clear error messages for unsupported file types or failed generations.
Include basic logging for debugging.
Deployment
Deploy webhook to a live URL (e.g., Render/Fly.io/Cloud Run).
Configure environment variables for tokens and keys.
Provide instructions for re-deployment or key rotation.
